### 📅 Planned (Future Epics)

**Commercial-Grade Hardware Integration**

  - [ ] **NPK Ion-Selective Electrodes (ISE):** Direct measurement of individual N, P, and K ratios to optimize Nutrient Use Efficiency (NUE) and prevent buildup.
  - [ ] **Advanced Flow Management:** Flowmeter support with automated flowrate calculation formulas tailored to specific crop types and channel sizes.
  - [ ] **Air Quality & Circulation:** HEPA filter maintenance tracking and anemometer integration to ensure optimal airflow (\>2m/s).
  - [ ] **Dedicated Agitator Control:** Independent relay support for motorized solution mixing (an optional alternative to the current pump-driven lockout cycle).

**System Architecture & Scaling**

  - [ ] **Master/Node Architecture:** Multi-node LoRa mesh support for commercial greenhouse scaling
  - [ ] **System Type Presets:** Out-of-the-box configurations for DWC, NFT, and Ebb & Flow setups
  - [ ] **Energy Monitoring:** Power consumption tracking and operational cost estimation

**Software & Ecosystem**

  - [ ] **Crop Recipe Database:** Downloadable, crop-specific optimal environmental profiles
  - [ ] **Multi-Language Support (i18n):** Global localization for the web dashboard and alerting system

**AI & Computer Vision**

  - [ ] **Camera Integration:** ESP32-CAM support for remote visual plant health monitoring
  - [ ] **AI Agronomy Assistant:** Conversational diagnostics, anomaly detection, and yield optimization recommendations
